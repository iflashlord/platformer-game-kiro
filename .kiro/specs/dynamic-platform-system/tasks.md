- [x] 6. Add visual feedback and particle effects system
  - Create particle effects that match platform type and color
  - Implement visual state indicators for breakable platforms
  - Add smooth color transitions and visual cues for break sequence
  - Scale particle effects based on platform dimensions
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.3, 4.5, 3.5_

- [x] 7. Integrate audio feedback through EventBus
  - Add sound effect triggers for platform touch, shake, and break phases
  - Implement positional audio for 3D sound placement
  - Create different sound effects for different platform types
  - Ensure audio integration works with existing EventBus system
  - _Requirements: 4.6, 3.6, 5.4_

- [x] 8. Create editor-friendly property system with real-time preview
  - Add @tool directive and editor-safe property setters
  - Implement immediate visual updates when properties change in editor
  - Create validation warnings for invalid configurations
  - Add visual handles for direct manipulation in editor viewport
  - _Requirements: 1.6, 1.8, 1.9, 1.10_

- [ ] 9. Implement dimension system integration
  - Add DimensionComponent for layer-based visibility and collision
  - Integrate with existing DimensionManager for layer switching
  - Ensure platforms only interact with players in active dimension
  - Create smooth layer transition effects
  - _Requirements: 2.7, 3.9, 5.3_

- [ ] 10. Add performance optimization and object pooling
  - Implement efficient particle system with object pooling
  - Optimize collision shape updates and memory usage
  - Add proper cleanup and resource management
  - Ensure 60 FPS performance with multiple platforms
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.5, 5.10_

- [ ] 11. Create comprehensive testing and validation system
  - Write unit tests for property validation and collision matching
  - Add integration tests for player interaction and break sequences
  - Create performance tests for multiple platform scenarios
  - Implement editor validation and configuration warnings
  - _Requirements: 1.8, 2.9, 5.8_

- [x] 12. Update DynamicPlatform.tscn scene with new structure
  - Restructure scene to use Sprite2D instead of NinePatchRect
  - Add BreakableComponent and DimensionComponent as child nodes
  - Configure default properties and node references
  - Ensure scene works properly in both editor and runtime
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 2.1, 3.4_

- [ ] 13. Create migration system for existing platforms
  - Build conversion utility for existing NinePatchRect-based platforms
  - Add property mapping from old system to new system
  - Create validation tools for converted platforms
  - Implement backward compatibility fallbacks
  - _Requirements: 5.6, 5.7_

- [ ] 14. Add comprehensive documentation and examples
  - Create usage examples showing different platform configurations
  - Write documentation for level designers on using the new system
  - Add code comments explaining key functionality
  - Create troubleshooting guide for common issues
  - _Requirements: 4.4, 5.8_

- [ ] 15. Final integration testing and polish
