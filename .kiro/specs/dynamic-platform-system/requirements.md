# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the DynamicPlatform system to provide a more intuitive and standardized editor experience with proper width/height controls, real-time visual preview, accurate physics collision matching, and improved breakable platform mechanics. The system will allow level designers to easily create and configure platforms directly in the Godot editor with immediate visual feedback and consistent behavior.

The enhancement focuses on three core areas: making the platform system editor-friendly with standard width/height properties, ensuring physics collision perfectly matches visual representation, and implementing responsive breakable mechanics that provide clear player feedback and smooth gameplay transitions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Editor-Friendly Platform Configuration

**User Story:** As a level designer, I want to configure platform dimensions using standard width and height properties in the Godot editor, so that I can quickly create platforms of any size with immediate visual feedback.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a level designer selects a DynamicPlatform in the editor THEN they SHALL see width and height properties in the inspector with pixel-precise input fields
2. WHEN a designer changes the width or height values THEN the platform SHALL immediately update its visual representation in the editor viewport
3. WHEN a platform is resized THEN the nine-slice texture SHALL stretch properly without distortion, maintaining corner and edge integrity
4. WHEN a designer creates a new DynamicPlatform THEN it SHALL default to a standard size (96x32 pixels) with proper texture and collision setup
5. WHEN platform dimensions are modified THEN the collision shape SHALL automatically update to match the exact visual boundaries
6. WHEN a platform uses different texture types (yellow, green, empty) THEN the editor SHALL show the correct texture preview immediately upon selection
7. WHEN a designer duplicates a platform THEN all size and configuration properties SHALL be preserved in the copy
8. WHEN platform properties are changed THEN the editor SHALL provide real-time validation warnings for invalid configurations
9. WHEN a platform is selected THEN the editor SHALL display visual handles for direct manipulation of width and height
10. WHEN changes are made THEN the platform SHALL maintain its position anchor point consistently during resizing operations

### Requirement 2: Accurate Physics and Collision System

**User Story:** As a player, I want platform collision to perfectly match the visual representation, so that movement and interactions feel precise and predictable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a platform is created or resized THEN its collision shape SHALL match the exact pixel boundaries of the visual representation
2. WHEN a player character lands on a platform THEN the collision SHALL occur precisely at the visual surface without gaps or overlaps
3. WHEN a platform has rounded corners or complex shapes THEN the collision SHALL approximate the visual shape as closely as possible
4. WHEN multiple platforms are placed adjacent to each other THEN there SHALL be no collision gaps or overlaps between them
5. WHEN a player moves along a platform edge THEN the collision SHALL provide smooth transitions without catching or stuttering
6. WHEN a platform is rotated THEN both visual and collision components SHALL rotate together maintaining perfect alignment
7. WHEN dimension-shifting occurs THEN platform collision SHALL be enabled/disabled appropriately based on the current layer
8. WHEN a platform is scaled THEN the collision shape SHALL scale proportionally with the visual representation
9. WHEN physics debugging is enabled THEN the collision shape SHALL be clearly visible and match the platform boundaries exactly
10. WHEN a platform interacts with other physics objects THEN the collision response SHALL be consistent with the visual representation

### Requirement 3: Responsive Breakable Platform Mechanics

**User Story:** As a player, I want breakable platforms to provide clear feedback and smooth gameplay transitions, so that I can anticipate platform behavior and plan my movements accordingly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player lands on a breakable platform THEN the countdown timer SHALL start immediately with clear visual and audio feedback
2. WHEN the countdown reaches the shake phase THEN the platform SHALL shake with increasing intensity while remaining functional
3. WHEN the platform breaks THEN it SHALL immediately disable collision and become non-solid for the player
4. WHEN a platform is shaking THEN the player SHALL still be able to stand on it and move normally until it breaks
5. WHEN a platform breaks THEN it SHALL trigger particle effects that match the platform's visual style and color
6. WHEN a breakable platform is triggered THEN it SHALL play appropriate sound effects for touch, shake, and break phases
7. WHEN multiple players or objects are on a breakable platform THEN the break sequence SHALL trigger only once from the first contact
8. WHEN a platform breaks THEN any objects or players on it SHALL fall naturally without artificial forces
9. WHEN a breakable platform is in different dimensions THEN it SHALL only respond to player contact in its active dimension
10. WHEN a platform completes its break sequence THEN it SHALL clean up all associated resources and remove itself from the scene

### Requirement 4: Visual Feedback and Polish

**User Story:** As a player, I want clear visual and audio feedback from platform interactions, so that I understand the game state and can make informed decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a breakable platform is touched THEN it SHALL provide immediate visual feedback through color changes or effects
2. WHEN a platform is shaking THEN the shake animation SHALL be smooth and predictable without causing motion sickness
3. WHEN a platform breaks THEN the particle effects SHALL be visually appealing and match the game's art style
4. WHEN platforms are in different states THEN each state SHALL have distinct visual indicators that are easy to understand
5. WHEN a player approaches a breakable platform THEN subtle visual cues SHALL indicate its breakable nature
6. WHEN sound effects play THEN they SHALL be appropriately positioned in 3D space and match the platform's material type
7. WHEN multiple platforms break simultaneously THEN the effects SHALL not overwhelm the player or cause performance issues
8. WHEN a platform is about to break THEN the final warning SHALL be unmistakable and give players time to react
9. WHEN platforms are viewed from different angles THEN the visual effects SHALL remain clear and readable
10. WHEN the game is paused THEN platform break sequences SHALL pause appropriately and resume correctly

### Requirement 5: Performance and Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the platform system to be performant and well-integrated with existing game systems, so that it enhances gameplay without causing technical issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple dynamic platforms are active THEN the system SHALL maintain 60 FPS performance on target web browsers
2. WHEN platforms break THEN the cleanup process SHALL not cause frame drops or memory leaks
3. WHEN the platform system integrates with the dimension system THEN layer switching SHALL be smooth and immediate
4. WHEN platforms interact with the audio system THEN sound requests SHALL be properly managed through the EventBus
5. WHEN platform effects are triggered THEN they SHALL use the existing object pooling system for optimal performance
6. WHEN save/load operations occur THEN platform states SHALL be properly serialized and restored
7. WHEN the game is exported for different platforms THEN the platform system SHALL work consistently across all targets
8. WHEN debugging tools are used THEN the platform system SHALL provide clear diagnostic information
9. WHEN the platform system is disabled THEN it SHALL gracefully degrade without affecting other game systems
10. WHEN memory usage is monitored THEN the platform system SHALL have predictable and reasonable resource consumption
