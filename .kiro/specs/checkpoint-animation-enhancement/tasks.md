# Implementation Plan

- [ ] 1. Add animation configuration variables to Checkpoint class
  - Add exported variables for bounce_height, bounce_duration, front_layer_offset, and scale_intensity
  - Set appropriate default values based on design specifications
  - Group variables under "Animation Settings" export group for better inspector organization
  - _Requirements: 1.6, 3.5_

- [ ] 2. Implement animation state tracking system
  - Add private variables to track original position, z-index, and animation state
  - Create helper methods to store and restore original checkpoint state
  - Implement animation conflict prevention using _is_animating flag
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 3.2_

- [ ] 3. Create enhanced bounce animation sequence
  - Replace existing simple scale tween with compound position and scale animation
  - Implement two-phase animation: upward bounce with ease_out, downward return with ease_in
  - Use parallel tweens for simultaneous position and scale changes
  - Set total animation duration to match design specifications (0.6-0.8 seconds)
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.5, 1.6, 2.1_

- [ ] 4. Implement dynamic z-index management
  - Store original z-index before animation starts
  - Boost z-index by front_layer_offset to bring checkpoint to front layer
  - Restore original z-index after animation completes
  - Ensure z-index changes don't affect collision detection
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 1.4, 2.4_

- [ ] 5. Add proper tween cleanup and error handling
  - Kill existing tweens before starting new animation to prevent conflicts
  - Implement animation completion callback to ensure state restoration
  - Add error handling for interrupted animations
  - Ensure proper memory cleanup of tween instances
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 3.2, 3.3_

- [ ] 6. Create unit tests for animation system
  - Write tests to verify animation timing and duration accuracy
  - Test z-index and position restoration after animation completion
  - Verify animation state tracking works correctly
  - Test tween cleanup and memory management
  - _Requirements: 2.2, 2.4, 3.1_

- [ ] 7. Test checkpoint animation integration
  - Test enhanced animation with existing checkpoint functionality
  - Verify audio and visual effects still work correctly
  - Test multiple checkpoint activations to ensure no conflicts
  - Validate animation performance with existing game systems
  - _Requirements: 2.2, 2.3, 3.4_
