# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the checkpoint activation animation to provide better visual feedback when players reach checkpoints. The current animation simply scales the flag sprite, but we want to create a more engaging bounce animation that moves the checkpoint to the front layer temporarily, making it more prominent and satisfying for players.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want the checkpoint flag to have a satisfying bounce animation when activated, so that I feel rewarded for reaching the checkpoint.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player touches a checkpoint THEN the flag SHALL bounce upward with a smooth animation
2. WHEN the bounce animation starts THEN the flag SHALL move to a higher z-index to appear in front of the player
3. WHEN the bounce reaches its peak THEN the flag SHALL smoothly return to its original position
4. WHEN the animation completes THEN the flag SHALL return to its original z-index layer
5. WHEN the bounce animation plays THEN it SHALL last approximately 0.6-0.8 seconds total
6. WHEN the bounce occurs THEN the flag SHALL move up by approximately 10-15 pixels at the peak

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want the checkpoint animation to feel natural and not interfere with gameplay, so that the visual enhancement doesn't disrupt my platforming experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the bounce animation plays THEN it SHALL use smooth easing curves for natural movement
2. WHEN the player is near the checkpoint during animation THEN the collision detection SHALL remain functional
3. WHEN multiple checkpoints are activated quickly THEN each SHALL animate independently without conflicts
4. WHEN the animation plays THEN it SHALL not affect the checkpoint's collision shape or functionality
5. WHEN the bounce completes THEN the checkpoint SHALL return to exactly its original visual state

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the animation system to be performant and reusable, so that it doesn't impact game performance and can be easily maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the animation system is implemented THEN it SHALL use Godot's Tween system for smooth performance
2. WHEN a checkpoint is activated THEN it SHALL clean up any existing tweens before starting new ones
3. WHEN the animation code is written THEN it SHALL be contained within the Checkpoint class
4. WHEN the z-index changes THEN it SHALL use relative adjustments to maintain proper layering
5. WHEN the animation parameters are defined THEN they SHALL be easily adjustable via exported variables
