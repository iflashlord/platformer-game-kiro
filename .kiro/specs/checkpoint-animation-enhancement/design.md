# Design Document

## Overview

This design document outlines the implementation of an enhanced checkpoint activation animation system. The enhancement will replace the current simple scale animation with a more engaging bounce animation that temporarily brings the checkpoint to the foreground, providing better visual feedback and player satisfaction.

## Architecture

### Current System Analysis
The existing checkpoint system uses:
- `Area2D` as the base node with collision detection
- `AnimatedSprite2D` for visual representation
- Simple tween-based scaling animation
- Z-index management through scene hierarchy

### Enhanced Animation System
The new system will extend the existing architecture by:
- Adding position-based bounce animation alongside scaling
- Implementing dynamic z-index manipulation
- Using compound tween sequences for smooth motion
- Maintaining backward compatibility with existing checkpoint functionality

## Components and Interfaces

### Checkpoint Class Enhancements

#### New Exported Variables
```gdscript
@export_group("Animation Settings")
@export var bounce_height: float = 12.0  # Pixels to bounce upward
@export var bounce_duration: float = 0.7  # Total animation time
@export var front_layer_offset: int = 100  # Z-index boost during animation
@export var scale_intensity: float = 1.3  # Maximum scale during bounce
```

#### Enhanced activate() Method
The `activate()` method will be redesigned to:
1. Store original z-index and position
2. Move checkpoint to front layer
3. Execute compound bounce animation
4. Restore original layer and position
5. Maintain existing audio and visual effects

#### Animation Sequence Design
```
Phase 1: Preparation (0.0s)
- Store original z_index and position
- Boost z_index for front layer visibility
- Kill any existing tweens

Phase 2: Upward Bounce (0.0s - 0.35s)
- Animate position.y upward by bounce_height
- Animate scale from 1.0 to scale_intensity
- Use ease_out curve for natural deceleration

Phase 3: Downward Return (0.35s - 0.7s)  
- Animate position.y back to original
- Animate scale from scale_intensity to 1.0
- Use ease_in curve for natural acceleration

Phase 4: Cleanup (0.7s)
- Restore original z_index
- Ensure exact position restoration
```

### Z-Index Management Strategy

#### Layer Hierarchy
Based on the project's layer system:
- Player layer: 2
- Checkpoint default layer: ~5-10 (estimated)
- Temporary front layer: original + front_layer_offset

#### Implementation Approach
```gdscript
# Store original z-index
var original_z_index = z_index

# Move to front during animation
z_index = original_z_index + front_layer_offset

# Restore after animation
z_index = original_z_index
```

## Data Models

### Animation State Tracking
```gdscript
# Internal state variables
var _original_position: Vector2
var _original_z_index: int
var _is_animating: bool = false
var _current_tween: Tween
```

### Tween Configuration
```gdscript
# Tween setup for smooth animation
var tween = create_tween()
tween.set_parallel(true)  # Allow simultaneous position and scale tweens
```

## Error Handling

### Animation Conflicts
- **Problem**: Multiple rapid activations could cause animation conflicts
- **Solution**: Check `_is_animating` flag and kill existing tweens before starting new ones

### Tween Cleanup
- **Problem**: Orphaned tweens could cause memory leaks
- **Solution**: Proper tween cleanup in animation completion callbacks

### State Restoration
- **Problem**: Interrupted animations might leave checkpoint in wrong state
- **Solution**: Always restore original position and z-index in cleanup methods

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing Approach
1. **Animation Timing Tests**
   - Verify total animation duration matches specification
   - Test that bounce height reaches expected peak
   - Confirm smooth easing curves

2. **State Management Tests**
   - Verify z-index restoration after animation
   - Test position accuracy after bounce completion
   - Confirm collision detection remains functional during animation

3. **Performance Tests**
   - Measure tween performance impact
   - Test multiple simultaneous checkpoint animations
   - Verify memory cleanup after animations

### Integration Testing
1. **Player Interaction Tests**
   - Test checkpoint activation during player movement
   - Verify animation doesn't interfere with player collision
   - Test rapid checkpoint activation scenarios

2. **Visual Validation Tests**
   - Confirm checkpoint appears in front of player during animation
   - Verify smooth visual transition throughout bounce sequence
   - Test animation consistency across different checkpoint instances

### Manual Testing Scenarios
1. **Basic Functionality**
   - Activate checkpoint and observe bounce animation
   - Verify checkpoint appears in front of player
   - Confirm smooth return to original state

2. **Edge Cases**
   - Activate checkpoint while player is overlapping
   - Test checkpoint activation during screen transitions
   - Verify behavior with modified animation parameters

## Implementation Notes

### Godot-Specific Considerations
- Use `create_tween()` for optimal performance
- Leverage `tween.set_parallel(true)` for simultaneous animations
- Implement proper signal connections for animation completion

### Performance Optimizations
- Reuse tween instances where possible
- Minimize property changes during animation
- Use efficient easing functions

### Backward Compatibility
- Maintain existing checkpoint functionality
- Preserve current audio and visual effect integration
- Ensure existing checkpoint scenes work without modification
