# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances Glitch Dimension with advanced gameplay systems that elevate the player experience through intelligent enemy AI behaviors, diverse collectible mechanics with strategic depth, and a sophisticated level progression system. These systems work together to create engaging moment-to-moment gameplay while providing long-term progression goals that keep players invested.
