# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current level selection system displays levels in a single vertical column showing 6 levels at once, but the user wants a horizontal layout showing 2.5 levels with smooth scrolling navigation. The system should provide better visual alignment, proper level activation, and an improved overall progress display.

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want level activation to work properly, so that I can actually start playing the levels I select.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN clicking on an unlocked level THEN the system SHALL load and start that level

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the level selection loads THEN the system SHALL display a visually appealing progress indicator
2. WHEN progress is shown THEN it SHALL include both numerical completion (X/Y levels) and visual progress bar
3. WHEN levels are completed THEN the progress display SHALL update to reflect current completion status
4. WHEN perfect scores are achieved THEN the progress display SHALL highlight exceptional performance

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a player, I want level cards to display clear status information, so that I can understand each level's unlock status, completion state, and my performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing level cards THEN each SHALL clearly show unlock status (locked/unlocked)
2. WHEN a level is completed THEN the card SHALL display completion indicators and best score
3. WHEN a level has perfect completion THEN the card SHALL show special visual effects or indicators
