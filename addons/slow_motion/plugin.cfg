name="Slow Motion"
description="Applies temporary slow motion globally (by gradually changing Engine time_scale), with smooth slowing down and speeding up ramps. 

Just call SlowMotion.slow_motion(duration, speed) from anywhere (you can also await it).

Ramps and overall duration are controlled using time from the OS, so they are not affected by the slowing itself, giving you guaranteed easy control on the duration and speed of the slow motion effect.

This plugin will ALSO slow down shaders, so VFX using the TIME builtin playing alongside will also follow neatly.
(There is currently no way to add exceptions for certain shaders to escape the slow motion. Sorry about that - it's an engine limitation.)"
