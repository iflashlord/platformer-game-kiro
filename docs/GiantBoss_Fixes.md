# Giant Boss System — Fixes and Notes

This document summarizes key fixes and current implementation details for the Giant Boss and related assets in this project.

## Key Fixes (Historical)

### GiantBoss.gd
- Removed any non-CharacterBody2D APIs (e.g., `set_gravity_scale()`), consolidating gravity handling in movement logic.
- Corrected color interpolation usage to instance form (e.g., `Color.RED.lerp(Color.GREEN, t)`).
- Cleaned unused parameters by prefixing with `_` where needed.

### InteractiveCrate (TNT)
- TNT functionality is provided by `actors/InteractiveCrate.gd` with `crate_type = "tnt"` rather than a separate `TNTCrate.gd`.
- Fixed animation/state handling for TNT fuse and explosion, including chain reactions via `actors/Explosion.gd`.

### BossHealthUI
- Ensured UI updates are driven by `EventBus.boss_health_changed(health, max_health)`.
- Minor parameter naming cleanup for clarity.

### Level_GiantBoss
- Uses generic types for onready vars to avoid compile‑time type issues.
- Renamed handler parameters (e.g., TNT position) to avoid shadowing built‑ins.
- Hides the portal until `boss_defeated`, then animates it in and enables monitoring.

## Testing (Current)

Use the included boss level or the level select:

- From game: use Level Select to open “The Giant’s Last Stand”.
- Direct: `godot --path . --main-scene res://levels/Level_GiantBoss.tscn`

Expected behavior:
- Boss moves, transitions phases across 5 hits, and drops TNT (InteractiveCrate) over time.
- TNT fuses, explodes, and can trigger chain reactions; boss is immune to TNT damage.
- BossHealthUI reflects damage and phases; screen shake and effects play on impact.
- Defeating the boss reveals and activates the level portal.

- `actors/InteractiveCrate.gd/.tscn` — TNT crates (`crate_type = "tnt"`)
- `actors/Explosion.gd/.tscn` — Explosion logic/effects
- `ui/BossHealthUI.gd/.tscn` — Boss health UI

## Notes & Next Steps

- Tune difficulty via exported variables in `GiantBoss.gd` (health, speeds, TNT cadence).
- Consider adding boss‑specific audio/music and variant attack patterns.
- Keep crate/bomb assets consistent with dimension layers where applicable.

The Giant Boss is production‑ready and integrated with UI, FX, Audio, and Persistence systems.
