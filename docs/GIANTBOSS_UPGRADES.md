# GiantBoss Professional Upgrades

## Overview
The GiantBoss has been enhanced with professional game features, improved TNT/bomb management, and sophisticated warning systems that rival AAA games.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Major Improvements**

### 1. **Phase-Based Bomb Limits**
Each phase now has specific limits for both TNT and bombs:

- **Phase 1 (Walking)**: 10 TNT, 5 Bombs
- **Phase 2 (Jumping)**: 8 TNT, 8 Bombs  
- **Phase 3 (Charging)**: 6 TNT, 12 Bombs
- **Phase 4 (Flying)**: 4 TNT, 15 Bombs

The boss becomes more bomb-focused in later phases while reducing TNT usage.
