# DynamicPlatform Editor Integration - Fixed

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Platform Visibility in Editor
**Problem**: Platforms were not visible in the Godot 2D editor when designing levels.

**Solution**: 
- Ensured `NinePatchRect.visible = true` in both editor and runtime
- Added proper editor setup in `_ready()` method
- Added `_configure_nine_patch()` call in editor mode

### 2. Inspector Property Updates
**Problem**: Changing `platform_size` in the inspector didn't update the platform visually.

**Solution**:
- Added `is_inside_tree()` checks to all property setters
- Added `notify_property_list_changed()` calls for editor updates
- Improved `_update_platform_size()` to properly sync all components
- Added proper collision shape updates

## Key Changes Made

### Property Setters Enhancement
```gdscript
func _set_platform_size(value: Vector2):
    platform_size = value
    if is_inside_tree():
        _update_platform_size()
        # Force update in editor
        if Engine.is_editor_hint():
            notify_property_list_changed()
```

### Editor Setup in _ready()
```gdscript
if Engine.is_editor_hint():
    # Editor setup - ensure platform is visible and properly configured
    _configure_nine_patch()
    _setup_collision()
```

### Improved Node References
- Added fallback node finding for existing scene nodes
- Proper owner assignment for editor-created nodes
- Better error handling for missing components

## Testing

Use `examples/EditorVisibilityTest.tscn` to verify:

1. **Editor Visibility**: All platforms should be visible in the 2D editor
2. **Size Changes**: Changing `platform_size` in inspector should immediately update the visual
3. **Type Changes**: Switching `platform_type` should change the texture
4. **Slice Modes**: Different slice modes should work properly

## Usage in Level Design

1. Add DynamicPlatform to your scene
2. Set `platform_size` in the inspector - changes are immediate
3. Choose `platform_type` (YELLOW, GREEN, EMPTY)
4. Configure `slice_mode` for different scaling behaviors
5. Enable `is_breakable` for destructible platforms

The platform will now properly update in real-time as you modify properties in the inspector, making level design much more efficient.
