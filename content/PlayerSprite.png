# PlayerSprite.png Placeholder
# This should be a 32x32 pixel PNG image containing:
# - A simple player character sprite
# - Green/blue color scheme to distinguish from enemies
# - Clear silhouette for easy recognition
# - Pixel art style recommended

# For now, the game will use a colored rectangle as defined in Player.tscn
# Replace this file with actual PNG artwork when available
