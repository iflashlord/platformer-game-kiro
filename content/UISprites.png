# UISprites.png Placeholder
# This should be a 128x64 pixel PNG image containing:
# - Button backgrounds and borders
# - Icons for menu items
# - Progress bars and UI elements
# - Touch control button graphics
# - Menu decorations and frames
#
# Layout can be flexible based on UI needs
# Should match overall game art style
# Clear, readable at small sizes
# Good contrast for accessibility

# For now, the game uses simple colored rectangles for UI
# Replace this file with actual PNG artwork when available
