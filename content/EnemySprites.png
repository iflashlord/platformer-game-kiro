# EnemySprites.png Placeholder
# This should be a 64x32 pixel PNG image containing:
# - Left half (0,0,32,32): Patrol enemy sprite (red/orange)
# - Right half (32,0,32,32): Charger enemy sprite (darker red)
# - Distinct from player character
# - Threatening appearance but not too scary
# - Pixel art style recommended

# For now, the game will use colored rectangles as defined in enemy scene files
# Replace this file with actual PNG artwork when available
